# Desktop Assistant

This project is the voice assistant I use on desktop,
it's a shell around the voice assistant I wrote for mobile.

It's packaged nicely or intended for public use, but if
you wanted to hook it up like I do, it can be useful for
setting timers etc while doing laundry.

## Current idiosyncrasies

Expects /HOME/Documents/git/Alarms to contain https://github.com/gaycodegal/LinuxAlarm

Expects linux

Expects music to be handled by a "quod libet" instance
Only music and timer and license commands really work

## Origin

This work is a derivative of another project I published at:
https://github.com/hobbycommandline/Hobby-Voice-Command-Line
